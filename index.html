                            As a project for university, I made a short cinematic trailer with a team of fellow students, utilizing motion capture to create the animations. I learned a lot about the technology and the work-flow surrounding it.

                            As part of a project, I was tasked with improving on the work-flow of motion capture suits. I created a <a href="https://github.com/somanyiro/AnimationLooper">Blender plug-in</a> for modifying motion capture data to create smoothly looping animations. This drastically reduces the amount of time artist need to spend on animation cleanup.

                    <p>
                        My childhood dream was to become a
                        game developer, because of this I
                        stumbled on programming very early on in
                        life. I quickly fell in love with it and I’ve
                        been coding ever since. Now I imagine my
                        future as a tool developer either for game
                        studios or other industries.
